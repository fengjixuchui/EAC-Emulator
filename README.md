# What does it do ?

it simulates an anti-cheat running on the system ( which it's not ), it stops the anti-cheat driver from running and we send our own code to the games client to basically say everything is running fine and the anti-cheat is running but its not so it allows you to connect/play games without it even running basically allowing you to debug/reverse/inject without any issues

this fully stops the driver from running on your system allowing you to have much better access to the game as if there was nothing running on the game at all

.text sections & .data sections in the game that gets protected from Detours. 
 other simple hooking libraries can be used + injected and used freely + undetected
